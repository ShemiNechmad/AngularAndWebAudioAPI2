To play the track we'll use AudioContext
To make changes, we'll use a gain node and a stereo panning node for this example.
To save the changes we'll use OfflineAudioContext

1. Create an angular project: ng new project-name
2. install web audio api for angular: npm install angular-audio-context
3. install file saver: npm install file-saver
4. import the web audio api to the app module
5. modify the html,css and ts files of the app component, with the code on the video.
You can find the code in a github link, added to the video.
